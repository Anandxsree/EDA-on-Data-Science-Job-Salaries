# EDA-on-Data-Science-Job-Salaries
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Data Science Job Salaries
Project Overview
This project explores salary trends in the field of data science using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset contains information on job roles, salaries, experience levels, company locations, and more. Through EDA, we uncover key insights into salary distributions, influencing factors, and industry trends.

#Key Analysis Performed
>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, data types, duplicates)
>Statistical Summary & Insights (Mean, median, variance, etc.)
>Salary Distribution Analysis (Histogram, boxplots, outlier detection)
>Impact of Experience on Salary (Visualizing trends across different levels)
>Job Location & Salary Trends (Analyzing salaries across different regions)
>Company Size vs. Salary (Comparing salaries across small, medium, and large companies)
>Correlation Analysis (Identifying relationships between salary and other factors)


#Tools & Technologies Used
>>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
>>Jupyter Notebook
>>Data Visualization Techniques
#Project Insights
Entry-level data scientists earn significantly less compared to senior roles.
Companies in the USA and Europe tend to offer the highest salaries.
Remote roles generally have competitive salaries.
Large companies often pay more than startups.

Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into factors affecting salaries in data science, helping professionals make data-driven career decisions.
