# EDA-on-Data-Science-Job-Salaries
Project Overview
This project explores salary trends in the field of data science using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset contains information on job roles, salaries, experience levels, company locations, and more. Through EDA, we uncover key insights into salary distributions, influencing factors, and industry trends.

Key Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, data types, duplicates)
Statistical Summary & Insights (Mean, median, variance, etc.)
Salary Distribution Analysis (Histogram, boxplots, outlier detection)
Impact of Experience on Salary (Visualizing trends across different levels)
Job Location & Salary Trends (Analyzing salaries across different regions)
Company Size vs. Salary (Comparing salaries across small, medium, and large companies)
Correlation Analysis (Identifying relationships between salary and other factors)
Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
